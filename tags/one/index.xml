&lt;h1 id=&#34;headline&#34;&gt;Headline&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipisicing elit. Deserunt quod maiores dicta beatae veniam delectus, quasi quaerat ipsa deleniti amet. Sed rem temporibus ducimus, nihil, facilis tempore ipsa minus beatae.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;1) UPW (ultrapure water) is not caustic. Conversely,
&lt;code&gt;in it&#39;s purest form it because acidic when exposed to atmosphere because it readily absorbs CO2&lt;/code&gt;, which converts to carbonic acid. However, by default, UPW can only have a pH of 7 (again when not exposed to air). So proper pH measurement can only be done inline or with proper buffers. We actually wrote a paper on this topic because researchers were always complaining that their water was acidic.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;2) UPW will corrode iron, brass, poor quality steel. However, it will not corrode stainless steel as long as the welds are proper, even then hard to make SS conducive to corrosion by UPW. Example, resistivity meters that we use are made from SS (need to be to conduct electricity across 2 metal probes to get a reading).&lt;/p&gt;
